# Unity : the basics

Unity is a real-time 3D game engine. It provides a framework in which one can rapidly build realtime interactive experiences, by providing a number of foundationalm modules that can be reused from game to game :

- a visual editor for creating/modifying 3D scenes
- abstractions to 3D graphics rendering on the graphics card 
- modules for handling user input (keyboard, mouse, gamepad, ...)
- modules for generating behaviour : physics, animation
- an animation loop into which we can insert our custom game logic


## Install Unity Hub and a Unity Editor

Start by download [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download), a special software for managing our Unity installations and projects.

Unity has many different versions, and new versions may appear during the developement lifecycle of the same project. It may be inadvisable to upgrade your version of Unity during development, so Unity Hub effectively allows us to open our project with the correct version of Unity.

To use Unity, you need to create a free account. Proceed with this and log in with Unity Hub.

Once connected, go to the Installs menu item, and click on "Install Editor". Choose the latest version of Unity and install the editor.

## Create a new Project

To create a new Project, open Unity Hub, and navigate to the Projects menu item, and click on New Project.

Unity provides a numbe of different predefined game templates depending on the type of game, target platform, type of rendering you wish to use. All can be modified later on.

For now, you may choose the template "Universal 3D".

You will be asked to specify a location on your disk for your unity project.

{% hint style="warning" %}

A unity project is a collection of directories and files. Be sure to choose a location that respects the following criteria :

- have enough disk space : at least 1 Go of space
- do not use network or shared drives (like Google Drive). This may cause unexpected errors!
- avoid locations that have special characters or spaces in the path. This may cause unexpected errors!

{% endhint %}

## Project files and GIT

You will notice that Unity creates an entire structure of files :

![](../graphics/unityfiles.png)

Some files are important for your project, while others are auto-generated by Unity.

The important files to include in your source control are :

- Assets : the primary location of all your scripts, 3D models, ...
- Packages : dependencies of your project
- ProjectSettings : global project settings

All the rest can be ignore in your source control.

Here is a sample `.gitignore` you can add to the root of your project :

```
/.vscode/
/Library/
/obj/
*.csproj
*.sln
/Temp/
/.vs/
/Log/
/Logs/
/Build/
/UserSettings/
```

Since a Unity project is media-heavy, I would advise also adding the following `.gitattributes` file at the root of your project too :

```
*.mov -delta
*.ogg -delta
*.ogv -delta
*.jpg -delta
*.png -delta
*.mp4 -delta
*.mp3 -delta
```

## Opening a project

I have provided a sample project with multiple demo scenes at this repository [https://github.com/glassworks/course-mmporg-sample](https://github.com/glassworks/course-mmporg-sample).

To open this project in Unity, open Unity Hub, and click on the "Add" button. Navigate to the root of my project, and select the directory containing the subdirectories Assets, Packages, ProjectSettings.

Unity Hub will add your project to the list. It may warn you about not having the right version of the editor. You may ignore this error if your installed version is the same major versio of unity (example 6). Just click on the dropdown and choose your installed version of Unity. 

Click on the project to open the Unity Editor.


## The editor

The Unity editor has multiple windows allowing for efficient editing of a game.


![](../graphics/unityeditor.png)

- **Scene** : this is where you visually modify your scene, add 3D objects, position them, change the camera etc. [Here is a guide for using the Scene view](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html).
- **Hierarchy** : all objects in our game belong to a global hierarchy of objects. At the root is our scene. Objects can be parented to other objects (inheriting their transforms).
- **Inspector** : Each object in unity contains a number of **components** and **fields** that can be visualed and modified via this window. Select any object in the Scene view or the Hierarchy view and you will see that object's attributes in the Inspector.
- **Project** : this window gives you a view into your Assets folder on the disk. Here you will create and store all the files needed for you game : scripts, 3D models, textures, animations, ....
- **Console** : all debug messages emitted by unity will be displayed on the console. It is very useful!


## Scenes

A **scene** is a logical construct that represents a single level in our game. 

It is also the root of a 3D hierarchy. 

Scenes in unity are stored in files with the extension `.unity`, and can be found in the Assets directory. To load a particular scene, you just need to navigate to it in the Projects window, and double click on it.

For example, to open the Pong scene, navigate to `Demos/Pong` and double click on the `Pong.unity` scene to open it :

![](../graphics/unitypong.png)

You can create a new scene via the `File` menu, and save it wherever you like under the Assets folder.

## Play mode

To test your game, you want to start the animation loop and put into action all the scripts and modules you have cabled together.

Click on the Play button at the top center of the screen.

![](../graphics/unityplay.png)

This will create a snapshot of your game, and start the animation loop.

The `Game` window will be shown, which renders the scene through the primary `Camera` camera in your scene.

Note that any changes you make here will be lost when you exit play mode!
